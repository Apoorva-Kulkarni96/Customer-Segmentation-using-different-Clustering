#### CONCLUSION:
​
Clustering is an unsupervised problem of finding natural groups in the feature space of input data. There are many different clustering algorithms, and no single best method for all datasets. 
​
In this case, reasonable grouping was found using **KMeans**. However, **MiniBatchKMeans** gave equivalent result to that of standard KMeans.
​
**Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering** gave somewhat similar result to KMeans.
​
**DBSCAN** does not give proper grouping in this case and some tuning is required.
​
Using **Mean Shift**, could not achieve a reasonable result on this dataset.
